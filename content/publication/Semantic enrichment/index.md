abstract: "3D reconstruction plays a pivotal role in capturing the built environment’s object shapes and appearances for diverse smart applications, such as indoor navigation and geometric digital twinning. Despite its significance, traditional Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques are ineffective in indoor environments, characterised by textureless walls, illumination variation, and other nuanced phenomena. Moreover, current learning-based MVS pipelines are often developed without considering indoor attributes and rely on costly ground truth data for performance optimisation. This paper presents the “IndoReal-MVS” dataset, a rich indoor-centric compilation reflecting real-world phenomena through advanced computer graphics. It also introduces unsupervised “IndoorMatchNet”, synergising Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and Pyramid Flowformer (PFF) for encoding complex indoor geometries. The pipeline proposes Multi-Scale Feature loss, Superpixel-based Normal Consistency and Depth Smoothness losses, designed for indoor geometric characteristics. Experiments showcase a 192% relative improvement over the baseline model at stringent error thresholds, advancing indoor 3D reconstruction tasks."
