abstract: Planning scan routes with prior knowledge can improve scan data quality
  and completeness. This paper presents a BIM-enabled approach to optimize quadruped
  robot navigation for automated 3D scanning. The BIM data schema is enriched with
  IndoorGML, integrating building geometry with spatial data to establish an indoor
  navigation model describing multi-scale spatial topological networks. This navigation
  model, which includes an enhanced greedy algorithm, optimizes quadruped robot scanning
  positions and traversal sequences. The scan planning optimization outperforms existing
  heuristic algorithms in computational efficiency, coverage, and scan point count.
  The BIM-enabled approach is validated on ROS and in real-world conditions with a
  3D LiDAR sensor integrated with a quadruped robot. The robotic scans achieve visible
  coverage of 70–90% of the structure, with a fluctuation of 0.006–0.021 mm compared
  to traditional laser scans. The findings demonstrate robotic scans as a viable way
  of obtaining complete and accurate point clouds, reducing human effort in traditional
  scanning.
